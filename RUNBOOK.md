### Fast gates

- health: `pnpm run build`
- lint: not applicable
- typecheck: not applicable
- test: not applicable
- build: `pnpm run build`
- security: `pwsh ../security/Invoke-RepoSecurityScan.ps1 -Path .`

### Release

Classify risk, run applicable gates locally, use one coherent preview when deployed, obtain an independent verifier verdict, record evidence, and confirm rollback before promotion. Only predesignated low-risk web changes may use green automatic promotion.
